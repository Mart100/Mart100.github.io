				After a while, you see the cubes start to head towards the finish.
				All of the cubes have a list of instructions, for example: (left, right, down, down, up, left). And they move according those instructions. 
				But after a new generation, there will be mutations of the best 10% of the previous generation (green), crossovers of the best 10% (blue) and the 10% themselves (red).
				This way, the spiecies in a whole will evolve. 
				How good a cube is, is calculated by how nearby it is from the finish and how many steps has it taken.

				MouseStrat is an online 2D strategy game. 
				With a plottwist... You can't see any of your opponents buildings. Only with the use of an ability.
				The goal of the game is to find where your opponent is hiding and destroy your opponents core.
				To achieve this you can use buildings and abilities. Altough these do cost energy.
				An important part of the game is that the opponent will be able to see your mouse.
				Knowing your opponent is able to see the position of your mouse, You are able to use this to lead your opponent to fake paths.
				Also make sure to manage your electricity, You can spend electricity on Power Towers to increase your electricity income. 
				But if you spend too much time focussing on this, Your opponent might have already found your core
				Will you be able to find and destroy your opponent before your opponent finds you?
