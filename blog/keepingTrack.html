			<h1>Making the "Keeping Track" app</h1>
			<p>
				In this "blog" or whatever this is. 
				I will write down my challenges and how I solved them.
				While trying to make an app for android where I can fill in statistics of each day, 
				such as waking up time and sleeping, and what I ate that day. A journal sort of.
			</p>

			<h2>Some info</h2>
			<p>
				So for this project I will use <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>. A framework by google for making crosscompatible apps.<br>
				And for saving the users data I will use firebase auth with firestore.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Learning basics</h2>
			<p>
				Note that I've never used Flutter or dart before, So before I could dive in blindly I thought it would be smart to get to know the basics.
			</p>
			<h3>Getting to know flutter</h3>
			<p>
				Not much to say here, I learned the basics of flutter and dart with 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ">this great video tutorial series</a>
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h2>Making the actual app</h2>
			<p>
				Yes, I know the previous paragraph was short, I got impatient and wanted to start on the actual app right away.
			</p>
			<h3>Creating the structure</h3>
			<p>
				So for this app I just simply want 4 pages to start with.
				<ul>
					<li>Home/Days</li>
					<li>Day info</li>
					<li>Edit day</li>
					<li>Login</li>
					<li>Loading</li>
				</ul>
				I will explain more about these pages one by one.
				<br>
				<h4>Home/Days</h4>
				<p>
					So this is without a doubt the most important page, 
					This page will contain a list of every day reported on small cards that give a summary.
					It will also have a button in the bottom right corner.
					I have made a sketch in paint.net to get an idea of how I want it to look:
					<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/qLZP750.png" style="max-width: 300px;">
				</p><br>
				<h4>Day info</h4>
				<p>
					So this will be the page that pops up when you click on a Day card in the Home/Days page,
					This will contain full information that has been filled in by the user.
					I also made a sketch for this page:
					<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ONVRnhS.png" style="max-width: 300px;">
				</p><br>
				<h4>Edit day</h4>
				<p>
					This page will be almost exactly the same as the Day info page, But it will be possible to edit the values.
				</p><br>
				<h4>Login</h4>
				<p>
					Now the login page, This page only has 1 purpose, which is making sure the user logins so firestore database can save their data.
					<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zhnRWXL.jpg" style="max-width: 300px;">
				</p><br>
				<h4>Loading</h4>
				<p>
					I don't think I need to explain much here, This page is just a simple page when anything needs to load. 
					And it has a fun little circle load thingy
				</p><br>
			</p>
			<h3>Creating the authentication / login</h3>
			<p>
				So in this part I will try to make the user successfully login with google,
				For this I use firebase auth. I mostly just followed <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-implementing-google-sign-in-71888bca24ed">This great tutorial</a>,
				I did struggle quite a lot with getting that to work ( ugh ugh took 4 hours),
				But this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54557479/flutter-and-google-sign-in-plugin-platformexceptionsign-in-failed-com-google">stackoverflow thread</a> has helped me a ton with resolving those issues.<br>
				But after I had this working, I honestly still had no idea how it worked, and how I could use it to store a users data.<br>
				So at this point I made a quick flowchart to better understand what has to happened and when:
				<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZCAXguG.png">
				<br>
				So I successfully did the Login Page and had gotten the User ID,<br>
				Now I had to send this data to the Loading page.<br><br>
				So I did that, It now sends the user ID to the loading page, and from the loading page it gets the users Data from the database.<br>
				And from there on, It sends that userData to the home/days page.<br>
